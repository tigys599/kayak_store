# yelpCamp
As I learn to use express, and MongoDB I am building a fake yelp application used for posting reviews on campgrounds

This application has a long ways to go before it will be slightly functional.

It requires MongoDB to be installed locally,
and several NPM packages to be installed through npm install

the express server by default listens on port 3000, and can be found in the index.js file in the root directory. 
Currently there is no variable assigned to easily edit the port settings.
